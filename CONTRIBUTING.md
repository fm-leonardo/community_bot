##### First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to the project!

This bot uses [py-cord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) (a fork of the well-known but discontinued [discordpy](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)) which can be installed by simply cloning the project and running the following command in the project root: 

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

py-cord docs can be found [here](https://pycord.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

---

New commands should be added to the `cogs` folder and follow the basic [py-cord cog](https://pycord.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/cogs.html) structure, other examples can also be found in said `cogs` folder.
They should also have no [blocking](https://pycord.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html?highlight=blocking#what-does-blocking-mean) code.

After you finish your command remember to add the command credits and a brief description to it!
